                    I am gonna honest from here on out, I actually have a crush on you since 1st year, Second Sem,
                    I bet that shock you, but its the truth, though i didn't pursue that feelings and immediately
                    dissolve the thought as I know you have a boyfriend that time, sorry if I lie to you

                    when I tell that I didn't know that you have a boyfriend that time, ever since, I just
                    thought of you as a friend that i can share answer with, thank you for those times
                    that you dont forget to give me some answer test, you were really helpful.
                    I never thought that we will be this close since the first time you chat me, asking
                    about the assignment we had, I thought that will be the first and last,

                    but that didn't happen, we became pretty close and even end up having special feelings for each
                    other.
                    you were one of the best classmate in my college days, you were a smart person, I notice it when you
                    were always
                    asking about my answer in programming, I actually thought why you always ask me if your answer was
                    already
                    correct in the first place

                    maybe you are not just that confident on your answer that time, but you have a talent on it, you are
                    also
                    a good leader, when we are preparing our final project in c++, you lead our group, you may not
                    notice it
                    but i am really grateful to you that time as i dont have any leadership talent, you decide
                    everything on the group
                    and i just did my part,

                    more problem to deal with, you were really the best classmate i had that time, which a shame as you
                    suddenly transfered on other section, ever since we rarely talk and we mostly just share answers.

                    about you,
                    I even react on your story on new years day as to get back on you (you were beautiful on that

                    around march of 2023 when you suddenly chat me in the morning, i think that was 5:00am in the
                    morning, sorry for
                    the reply that time though as i have a saturday class that time. i reply to you jokingly that time
                    but inside
                    i am really shock as to what is your reason on chatting me, throughout of our chat that time we talk
                    some serious

                    time was right, we have a really good chat that time and actually my classmate notice our chat
                    as i am chatting on you at class, though i just simply denied their teasing that time
                    as it is impossible for someone like you to be interested with me.

                    some other time in april, i notice that you were gone on my contacts on facebook
                    (the contact list beside news feed you see if you are using fb on pc), which makes me worried that
                    maybe i overstep
                    my boundary since our last chat and say some unnecessary things, which i though the reason why you
                    unfriend me, but
                    luckily you just deactivated your facebook account, but i cant stay calm that time

                    thats why i decided to chat you
                    to clarify it, and you said that it was normal for you to deactivate your account
                    although im relieved that you didn't unfriend me, i am still worried as why you have to deactivate
                    your account,
                    you also tell me on that conversation that i am handsome, a compliment i will never forget as that
                    was the first time

                    ever since that conversation, i decided to chat you everytime you're deactivating your account
                    asking you if you are okay, or sending some motivational post so that i can atleast lift up your
                    mood, till my birthday comes, i am actually not expecting you to greet me as i didn't even told you
                    my birthday, that's why it was unexpected, but a fun day cause of you.

                    After my birthday, i thought we were good that time, till one time i send you the date of enrollment
                    for
                    that semester, as we talk about one time that maybe you are planning to enroll for that semester,
                    although i am lying

                    it go,
                    but contrary to my expectation, you unfollow me on ig, that was devastating for me as i thought
                    maybe i offend you
                    by sending the enrollment date that time, im really depressed that time and sorry if i offend you, at
                    that time i also
                    realize my feelings for you, that i really like you that time,

                    cause i really dont care if someone
                    cut me off, but when
                    it comes to you, it really makes me sad. but i didn't chat you that time because i am afraid that i really offend
                    you, that's why i decided to let it go, i thought maybe that was the end of our relationship, 
                    that maybe is as far as it goes, till august where you make my world spin again.

                    I didn't expect to have a conversation from you ever since, it's sad but that's how it is, till one day, you suddenly 
                    chat me asking for help about your wifi, as you said there's someone connecting and you can't block them, i decided to help you
                    with all i can but you said they can still access your wifi

                    though i dont know if you fix that, after that you suddenly 
                    request for my help anything about your electronics, from your hard drive to wirings, which i think is a blessing in disguise
                    as i have more reason to talk to you, i am really happy that time because we have more chances to talk, we really became close that time
                    which cause me to like you more, but i had to repressed my feelings for you

                    I am scared to destroy what we had that time, that's why i try to stop this feeling, but that failed, i'd already fallen for you.
                    The more i try to suppress my feelings, the more you have open up to me, you tell me all your worries in life, what is your condition
                    and what is your illness, we even have our first fight that time, which now that i think about it was a silly fight (i really want you to cherish yourself more).

                    and fail misserably even though it was obvious, i turn a blind eye on your feelings,
                    the other half of me wants to accept my feelings but the other one try to deny it,
                    this decisiveness is maybe the cause on why we turn cold again.

                    into motivation as that was the currently the busiest time of my life because of thesis, you are the reason why

                    to finally confessed to you, and i decide to do it on valentines day, i spend sleepless nights to finish the website i made for you because 
                    i really want it to be special, but due to lack of time and a really busy schedule, that's all i can manage,

                    you told me that you have a crush on me before, i really cannot focus on that day, but luckily my seniors at work doesn't get angry on me
                    i thought that was the end, i am not chosen once again,

                    i dont know, its funny That
                    i am feeling like this even though i haven't even met you, its laughable why i am going crazy like this, but that's really how i feel, i try everything

                    and i am not forcing myself to try for you, i am doing this because you're the person that i really want, i am not asking right now, but i am asking for the future.

                    No matter your answer is, I will wait for you, even though i will end up being alone all my life, i can take that if there's a chance
